<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the joys of my current profession is constant exposure to
individuals and organizations that label themselves “experts” in any given
discipline. Having been exposed to this perk yet again this holiday season, I
feel compelled to draft my thoughts on the subject. It should be noted I do not
claim to be an expert in any given discipline; I do however feel my experience
lends itself to a unique perspective on many topics and subjects. My technical
career spans several fields seemingly unrelated and diverse. I have been
employed professionally as the following in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Automotive Technician</li>
<ul>
    <li><a title="ASE" href="https://www.ase.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">ASE</a> Certified Master Auto, L1, Body and Heavy Truck</li>
    <li>Automatic Transmissions</li>
    <li>Electronics Drivability</li>
    <li>Diesel Fuel Injection</li>
    <li>Heavy Line</li>
    <li>Fuel &amp; Ignition pit crew in an <a title="ARCA" href="http://www.arcaracing.com/" target="_blank">ARCA</a> stock car team</li>
</ul>
    <li>Director of Information technology for a Fortune 500 company.</li>
    <li>Shop Foreman for the manufacturing and maintenance of oil-field equipment.</li>
    <li>Garde Manger and Saucier Chef.</li>
    <li>Software Developer and Software Architect.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is more; for the sake of brevity, I have kept this list short. For
many years, I have kept this list a secret professionally, as it often sparks
questions of ability, sanity and reliability. My lack of formal secondary
education is often raised in job interviews and is just as often difficult to
address, depending on the job market. With my introductions complete, I would
like to share my thoughts on what does and does not make an expert. The list of
things I believe that do make an expert will most assuredly be a list much
smaller than what is generally accepted.</p>

<h3>The expert</h3>


<p><span>It is my belief that to become an expert in any field one must know
enough to not be entirely sure of all aspects of a given problem. An expert will
have the experience and wisdom to know there are no simple solutions; that all
problems can and usually do have multiple facets. This expert will know that
answers cannot come from one book, author, magazine or periodical; but rather
from the mistakes and pains of failure. This individual will recognize that
while there is the most common solution, there will one day be that problem
that is rarely seen; knowing this and knowing how to address it is the making
of an expert.</span></p>

<h3>Not the expert</h3>


<p>An individual reading one or two books that present canned problems and
solutions as examples does not make a person an expert regardless of how well
this person absorbs the lessons. This individual possesses only enough knowledge
to begin the path to understanding one or two facets of the possibilities that
can and will arise. It is important to understand that these publications have
carefully filtered these problems for the most common denominator and to be
publicly consumable. These solutions are merely best case recipes one can
hope for and, often times, serve no real world problem solving knowledge on
the topic.  Until the individual can readily find oneself presented with
problems that does not return results in a Google search and solve these
problems without the help of IRC or any others, he should not claim the title
of expert in such matters.</p>

<p>Commercially there are also companies that ply their wares, posing as experts
in a given problem field hoping to take your money and make you happy. Far too
often, I find these companies have a narrow range of problems they solve and it
is far too easy to get started on a solution only to discover your particular
use case is not supported or solved by the experts&#8217; offerings. This is similar
to the individual case of not having seen enough of the problems or simply
not having possessed the user base to be adaquate to solve the problem.</p>

<h3>In Summary</h3>


<p>Ultimately, it is important to recognize that consultant companies are often
motivated for more selfish reasons than the individual to obfuscate their
status, or lack thereof, as experts, so that they may lure us into a contractual
obligation.  For individuals, it is often ignorance, narcissism and/or pride
that often motivates the proclamations of subject matter experts from all parts
of life. The holidays are especially bountiful for examining these persons to
watch them in the wild and view their natural behaviors. Whether it is a parent
instructing you in the disciplines of child rearing or a CEO expounding the
joys of the latest whiz-bang idea they read on Joe Schmoes Blog; it is
up to us non-experts to filter the wheat from the chaff, filter the
good from the trash.</p>
